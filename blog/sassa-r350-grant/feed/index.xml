<p>To help people who are struggling financially, the South African government provides different grants or money assistance.</p>



<p>However, many people who receive these grants are confused about how to apply, who qualifies, and how they get paid.</p>



<p>In this article, I&#8217;ll share my personal experience specifically with how grant money is paid out. I&#8217;ll also explain how to change the payment method for the SASSA R370 grant if you need to. Let&#8217;s get started!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Change SASSA R370 Payment Method</h2>



<p> To Change SASSA R370 Payment Method Here are the steps should take:</p>



<ul>
<li> first, visit the official SASSA website: <a href="http://srd.sassa.gov.za/" data-type="link" data-id="srd.sassa.gov.za" target="_blank" rel="noopener">srd.sassa.gov.za</a></li>



<li> scroll down to the section that says &#8220;How do I change my banking Details?&#8221;</li>



<li>clicked on the link that says &#8220;Apply for changes and change the payment method for SASSA R350 grant from post office to online bank account&#8221;</li>



<li>A  form will open up where you will enter your new bank account information and after that click on submit</li>
</ul>



<p>When I first applied for the SASSA grant, I registered using my cell phone number. So when I changed my payment details, SASSA sent me a message about it on my phone.</p>



<p>Overall, my experience with SASSA has been good so far. I get my grant payment on time without any problems now. If you are still going to the post office and shops to get your SASSA R370 grant, I really encourage you to change your payment method to direct bank deposit instead.</p>
