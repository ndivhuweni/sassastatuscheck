<p>In this article, I will explain how to change the banking details for your SASSA (South African Social Security Agency) grant. Previously  I did this because I wanted to switch from FNB Bank to Capitec Bank to receive my R370 SASSA grant payments. I was worried that the grant money might delayed during the change.</p>



<p>However, the process ended up being much easier than I thought it would be. I learned some helpful things along the way, and now I want to share my experience to make it a smooth process for you too.</p>



<p>Whether you have changed banks recently, made a mistake on your initial SASSA grant application, or simply want to update your details, I will walk you through all the steps needed to change your SASSA grant banking details</p>



<p>.</p>



<p><strong>There are important things to remember:</strong></p>



<p>You can only change your banking details to a bank account in your name. SASSA will not send money to someone else&#8217;s account.</p>



<p>Only request a change if your bank account details are different now, or if you made a mistake when you entered them originally.</p>



<p>Have your South African ID number and the cell phone number you used when you applied for the grant ready. You will need these to make the change.</p>

</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Wait for a Confirmation SMS:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>SASSA will send a special text message (SMS) to the cell phone number you used when you first applied for the grant. This may take a few minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Open the Link in the SMS:</strong> Once you receive the text message,

<p>To help people who are struggling financially, the South African government provides different grants or money assistance.</p>



<p>However, many people who receive these grants are confused about how to apply, who qualifies, and how they get paid.</p>



<p>In this article, I&#8217;ll share my personal experience specifically with how grant money is paid out. I&#8217;ll also explain how to change the payment method for the SASSA R370 grant if you need to. Let&#8217;s get started!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Change SASSA R370 Payment Method</h2>



<p> To Change SASSA R370 Payment Method Here are the steps should take:</p>



<ul>
<li> first, visit the official SASSA website: <a href="http://srd.sassa.gov.za/" data-type="link" data-id="srd.sassa.gov.za" target="_blank" rel="noopener">srd.sassa.gov.za</a></li>



<li> scroll down to the section that says &#8220;How do I change my banking Details?&#8221;</li>



<li>click on the link that says &#8220;Apply for changes and change the payment method for SASSA R350 grant from post office to online bank account&#8221;</li>



<li>A  form will open up where you will enter your new bank account information and after that click on submit</li>
</ul>



<p>When I first applied for the<strong><a href="https://350statuscheck.org.za/sassa-payment-dates-for-may-2024/" data-type="link" data-id="https://350statuscheck.org.za/sassa-payment-dates-for-may-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> SASSA grant</a></strong>, I registered using my cell phone number. So when I changed my payment details, SASSA sent me a message about it on my phone.</p>



<p>Overall, my experience with SASSA has been good so far. I get my grant payment on time without any problems now. If you are still going to the post office and shops to get your SASSA R370 grant, I really encourage you to change your payment method to direct bank deposit instead.</p>
