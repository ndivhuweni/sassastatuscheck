I get my grant payment on time without any problems now. If you are still going to the post office and shops to get your SASSA R370 grant, I really encourage you to change your payment method to direct bank deposit instead.<\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1714587123959\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">How long does it take for SASSA to verify banking details<\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>SASSA typically completes the verification of your bank account details within seven working days.
