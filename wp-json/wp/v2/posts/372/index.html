Previously  I did this because I wanted to switch from FNB Bank to Capitec Bank to receive my R370 SASSA grant payments. I was worried that the grant money might delayed during the change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the process ended up being much easier than I thought it would be. I learned some helpful things along the way, and now I want to share my experience to make it a smooth process for you too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you have changed banks recently, made a mistake on your initial SASSA grant application, or simply want to update your details, I will walk you through all the steps needed to change your SASSA grant banking details<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There are important things to remember:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can only change your banking details to a bank account in your name. SASSA will not send money to someone else&#8217;s account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only request a change if your bank account details are different now, or if you made a mistake when you entered them originally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have your South African ID number and the cell phone number you used when you applied for the grant ready. You will need these to make the change.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" data-id=\"379\" src=\"https:\/\/sasa.amapianosongs.xyz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/pexels-lucasandrade-19848073-1024x683.webp\" alt=\"How To Change Banking Details for SASSA\" class=\"wp-image-379\" srcset=\"https:\/\/sasa.amapianosongs.xyz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/pexels-lucasandrade-19848073-1024x683.webp 1024w, https:\/\/sasa.amapianosongs.xyz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/pexels-lucasandrade-19848073-300x200.webp 300w, https:\/\/sasa.amapianosongs.xyz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/pexels-lucasandrade-19848073-768x512.webp 768w, https:\/\/sasa.amapianosongs.xyz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/pexels-lucasandrade-19848073-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https:\/\/sasa.amapianosongs.xyz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/05\/pexels-lucasandrade-19848073-2048x1365.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Change Banking Details for the SASSA R370 Grant<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>First, Visit the Official SASSA Website:<\/strong> \n<ul>\n<li>Visit srd.sassa.gov.za &#8211; this is the official website for SASSA.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Find the Section Called &#8220;How do I change my banking details&#8221;:<\/strong> \n<ul>\n<li>Scroll down the website until you see a section called &#8220;How do I change my bank details?&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Type in Your ID Number:<\/strong> \n<ul>\n<li>Carefully enter your South African ID number in the box provided.
